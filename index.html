    <p>My love, I’m really sorry.
I know I hurt you, and that’s the last thing I ever want to do. You mean so much to me — more than words can ever explain. You’re the person who brings peace to my heartt, happiness to my days, and love to my life.

I hate knowing that I made you feel upset. I never want to be the reason for your tears. You are incredibly special to me… not just as my girlfriend, but as the one person I can’t imagine my life without.

Please forgive me. I promise to understand you better, love you deeper, and never make you feel this way again.
You are everything to me. 💛</p>

      <p>When our paths first crossed, it wasn’t planned, and it wasn’t special to anyone else… but to me, it became one of the most important moments of my life. I still remember that day during our FA Maths exam — the moment I saw you. It felt like the whole room suddenly slowed down. Everyone else was busy writing, but my eyes kept finding you again and again, like they already knew where they belonged.

From that day, every time I saw you in school — walking in the corridor, laughing with your friends, or just passing by — my heart felt something I couldn’t explain. It was simple, quiet, but powerful. You didn’t even know it, but you were the best part of my everyday life.

Every glance, every tiny moment with you became a memory for me. I started waiting for school just so I could see you, even if it was just for a few seconds. You became the reason my normal days felt special.

And today, when I look back, I realize it wasn’t just a small crush or a passing feeling. It was something real. Something pure. Something my heart chose long before I even understood it.

I love you so much. More than I can say in words. And those small moments in school — especially that maths exam day — will always be the beginning of our beautiful story.

You are special to me, more than you’ll ever know. 💛</p>

    <h2>Apology</h2>

    <p>Dear Harshitha (ma avida garu)</p>
    <p>I am truly sorry for my actions...</p>

    <p>I’m really, really sorry 💛. I never wanted to make you feel uncomfortable, not even for a moment. The thought that something I did hurt you is tearing me apart inside. I didn’t mean it in a wrong way… it just happened, and I wish I could go back and stop it. I’ve been thinking about it again and again, and I even cried because I can’t stand the idea of making you feel hurt or uneasy 😔💛.

You are so special to me — truly, deeply special 💛. I respect you, your feelings, and your comfort more than anything. The last thing I ever want to do is make you feel awkward or upset because of me. You deserve nothing but love, warmth, and safety when you’re with me.

I promise you, with all my heart, that I will never let this happen again 💛. I’ll be more careful, more understanding, and more gentle with everything I say and do. I value you more than my own self, and I never want to lose the peace and happiness you bring into my life.

I’m really sorry, love 😔💛. I hope you can forgive me — not because I deserve it, but because my love for you is real, pure, and full of respect 💛.

You mean the world to me 💛.</p>

    <h3>A Symphony of Apology from My Falling Heart</h3>
    <h4>
    </h4>



    <p>Dear Avida garu,</p>

    <p>I don’t know where to start, because when I think of you, my heart fills with a thousand emotions at once. But today, more than anything else, I want to share my heart with you — honestly, openly, and with all the love I carry inside.

Harshitha… you are someone truly special in my life. From the first moment I saw you, to every small glance, every smile, every conversation after that — you became a part of me without even trying. I never imagined that one person could matter to me this much, but you do. More than words, more than anything.

I know I made mistakes. I know I hurt you without meaning to, and that thought has been weighing on my heart so heavily. I cried thinking about it, because you never deserved even a moment of discomfort from me. You deserve only respect, love, and peace — and I am so sorry for the pain I caused.

Harshitha, please know this…
My feelings for you are genuine, strong, and full of respect. You are not just someone I like — you are someone who touches my soul. You are the girl who made ordinary days feel special, who made me smile without reason, who made my heart understand what real affection feels like.

I would never, ever want to lose you.
I would never want a single memory with you to fade.
And I would never want to be the reason a tear falls from your eyes.

I’m willing to grow, to change, to understand you better, and to protect your feelings with all my heart. You matter that much to me. Your happiness matters that much to me.

If you need time or space, I respect it.
But I’ll be here — with patience, with love, and with a heart that truly cares for you.

Harshitha, you are special.
You are precious.
And you mean more to me than you will ever know.

With all my love,
Revanth 💛</p>
